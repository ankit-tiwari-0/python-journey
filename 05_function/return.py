# NOthin -> implicitly return None
# one Value
# multiple Value
# early from a function




















# cenario	What it Does
# No return	Function gives None by default
# One return value	Sends back a single value (string, number, etc.)
# Multiple return values	Returns a tuple (can be unpacked into variables)
# return ends function	Code after return does not run
# pass in function	Function does nothing, used as a placeholder
# Function not called	Nothing happens unless the function is called
# Returned value stored	You can store the returned value in a variable
# print() inside function	Prints something but does not return anything
# Function with conditions	Can return different things based on logic/conditions
# Underscore _ in unpacking	Used to ignore values you donâ€™t need from return
